To create a histogram, we will use pandas hist() method. Calling the hist() method on a pandas dataframe will return histograms for all non-nuisance series in the dataframe. Most of the time, when visualizing data, you want to highlight specific variables. To do this using pandas histograms, you would need to utilize it’s parameters.
